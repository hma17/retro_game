AR1 - AR Just Dance
The idea for AR Just Dance was inspired by the game Just Dance, where the user imitates the dancer on the screen as accurately as possible. In our game the AR dancer is controlled by buttons on the screen that each activate a unique dance move. The goal for the user is to sync up their command inputs with the given prompts. With each correct choice, the user gains points and accumulates a total score by the end of the song. The user’s objective is to beat their high score (which is specific to their instance of the app).
The biggest challenges with building this app would be syncing up the user command inputs with the prompts and adding a score keeper.
An extension of this app could include a “freestyle” feature where the user can decide on any combination of button pushes. This way the user has the autonomy to create their own choreography to the music of their choice. They can save the dance they create as a video.
Some applications of this app include recreational use and dance choreography visualization.
